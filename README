Odoc_depgraph is an ocamldoc custom html generator allowing to insert
module dependency graphs in html pages. The graphs are images with
associated maps so that you can click on a module name to jump
to its documentation.

=== Pre-requisites
Odot must be installed:
  http://home.gna.org/cameleon/odot.en.html
(alone or with cameleon2)

=== Compilation
# make
# make install
  This will install the ocamldoc plugins in the ocamldoc custom generator
  directory (obtained with ocamldoc -customdir).

=== Usage
As other ocamldoc custom generators, use the -g option of ocamldoc
to use the generator:
  ocamldoc -g odoc_depgraph.cma ....
or
  ocamldoc.opt -g odoc_depgraph.cmxs ...

See the "test" and "test2" targets in Makefile, which use the
test/*.ml files to generate some doc.

The custom generator introduces a new notation to insert
module dependency graphs in ocamldoc comments:
  {modgraph Module1 Module2 Module3 ...}
or
  {modgraph[attributes] Module1 Module2 Module3 ...}

Attributes are of the form
  key=value, key=value, ...

Supported keys are by now "width", "height" and "zoom" with
a float as value.

See file intro.text for an example of usage.
